First javascript project rock paper scissors game

/* Made/continued 1/20/2025 */
-This is the first javascript project part of the foundational courses.
-This is to practice the programming/problem solving principles we learned in a previous chapter
by coding the logic to run in the console, no UI yet.
-Plan the solution with pesudocode, then write the code, then test the solution.
-Break the problem down into smaller problems. Divide and conquer.
-Use comments and the debugger to fix bugs in the code.
